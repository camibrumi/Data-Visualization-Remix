This is a spaghetti chart, it is difficult at a glance to see which line belongs to which company and also it is difficult to see how many spaceships have launched every company along each year.

Improved chart with interaction: <br>

The improved chart uses the color channel for the different companies (design achievement). Also it has interaction. When the user hovers the mouse over a point, the number of spaceships and the year details are displayed in a tooltips. This feature was not in the starter code I have found for the line chart (technical achievement).

## The code of the Visualization
Can be found in the linesWithDots folder. The other file are trials of the same projects but with different starter codes. Those ones did not work as expected.

## Data
Extracted by sight. Can be found in the linesWithDots folder as data.csv.
